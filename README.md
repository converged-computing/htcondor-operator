# htcondor-operator

> Let's make one for HTCondor too!

This will be an operator that attempts to use [htcondor](https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor) to create a cluster to run tasks. Note that I'm going off of the list [here])(https://github.com/dask/dask-jobqueue/tree/main/ci) (plus Flux). We will use the design and referenced docker-compose [from here](https://github.com/dask/dask-jobqueue/blob/main/ci/htcondor/docker-compose.yml),
and the base images [are here](https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/tree/main/build/docker/services).

## Development

### Creation

```bash
mkdir htcondor-operator
cd htcondor-operator/
operator-sdk init --domain flux-framework.org --repo github.com/converged-computing/htcondor-operator
operator-sdk create api --version v1alpha1 --kind HTCondor --resource --controller
```

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster

Create a cluster with kind:

```bash
$ kind create cluster
```

You'll need to install the jobset API, which eventually will be added to Kubernetes proper (but is not yet!)

```bash
VERSION=v0.1.3
kubectl apply --server-side -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/jobset/releases/download/$VERSION/manifests.yaml
```
or development version (this is what I did):

```bash
$ kubectl apply --server-side -k github.com/kubernetes-sigs/jobset/config/default?ref=main

# This is right before upgrade to v1alpha2, or June 2nd when I was testing!
# This is also a strategy for deploying a test version
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/jobset /tmp/jobset
cd /tmp/jobset
git checkout 93bd85c76fc8afa79b4b5c6d1df9075c99c9f22d
IMAGE_TAG=vanessa/jobset:test make image-build
IMAGE_TAG=vanessa/jobset:test make image-push
IMAGE_TAG=vanessa/jobset:test make deploy
```

Generate the custom resource definition

```bash
# Build and push the image, and generate the examples/dist/htcondor-operator-dev.yaml
$ make test-deploy DEVIMG=<some-registry>/htcondor-operator:tag

# As an example
$ make test-deploy DEVIMG=vanessa/htcondor-operator:test
```

Make our namespace:

```bash
$ kubectl create namespace htcondor-operator
```

Apply the new config!

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f examples/dist/htcondor-operator-dev.yaml
```

See logs for the operator

```bash
$ kubectl logs -n htcondor-operator-system htcondor-operator-controller-manager-6f6945579-9pknp 
```

Create a "hello-world" interactive cluster:

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f examples/tests/hello-world/htcondor.yaml 
```

Ensure pods are running:

```bash
$ make list
kubectl get -n htcondor-operator pods
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
htcondor-sample-execute-0-0-wwzxk   1/1     Running   0          57s
htcondor-sample-execute-0-1-tszkn   1/1     Running   0          57s
htcondor-sample-manager-0-0-4x6dj   1/1     Running   0          57s
htcondor-sample-submit-0-0-jfbh6    1/1     Running   0          57s
```

The cluster will have a central manager, a submit node, and two execution nodes.
You can look at their logs to see the cluster running:

```console
++ condor_config_val -evaluate MAX_FILE_DESCRIPTORS
+ config_max=
+ [[ '' =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]
+ [[ -s /etc/condor/config.d/01-fdfix.conf ]]
+ [[ -f /root/config/pre-exec.sh ]]
+ bash -x /root/config/pre-exec.sh
+ exec /usr/bin/supervisord -c /etc/supervisord.conf
2023-06-18 21:23:07,831 INFO Set uid to user 0 succeeded
2023-06-18 21:23:07,851 INFO RPC interface 'supervisor' initialized
2023-06-18 21:23:07,851 CRIT Server 'unix_http_server' running without any HTTP authentication checking
2023-06-18 21:23:07,851 INFO supervisord started with pid 1
2023-06-18 21:23:08,855 INFO spawned: 'condor_master' with pid 39
2023-06-18 21:23:09,857 INFO success: condor_master entered RUNNING state, process has stayed up for > than 1 seconds (startsecs)
```

Now let's shell into submit and see if we can interact! This is only the second time I'll use htcondor so with me luck :)

```bash
$ kubectl exec -it -n htcondor-operator htcondor-sample-submit-0-0-jfbh6 bash
```

I think the instructions we want are for [condor_submit](https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users-manual/submitting-a-job.html)
and it also looks like we need a submit file for that, let's write one:

```bash
tee -a submit.sh <<EOF

# Example 1
# Simple HTCondor submit description file
# Everything with a leading # is a comment

executable   = /usr/bin/echo
arguments    = hello world

output       = hello-world.out
error        = hello-world.err
log          = hello-world.log

request_cpus   = 1
queue
EOF
```

Note that it takes 5-10 minutes for the cluster to start working? At least for me I got hangs and errors and then
magically I got a response... here is how to see the Q

```bash
$ condor_q


-- Schedd: htcondor-sample-submit-0-0.htc-service.htcondor-operator.svc.cluster.local : <10.244.0.86:34081?... @ 06/18/23 23:14:58
OWNER BATCH_NAME      SUBMITTED   DONE   RUN    IDLE   HOLD  TOTAL JOB_IDS

Total for query: 0 jobs; 0 completed, 0 removed, 0 idle, 0 running, 0 held, 0 suspended 
Total for all users: 0 jobs; 0 completed, 0 removed, 0 idle, 0 running, 0 held, 0 suspended
```

and then when I submit:

```bash
$ condor_submit submit.sh 
Submitting job(s).
1 job(s) submitted to cluster 2.
```

I don't see anything running - I need to ask someone that knows how this works (or keep debugging myself). It's at least
a good start.

```bash
$ condor_q


-- Schedd: htcondor-sample-submit-0-0.htc-service.htcondor-operator.svc.cluster.local : <10.244.0.86:34081?... @ 06/18/23 23:16:51

Total for all users: 1 jobs; 0 completed, 0 removed, 1 idle, 0 running, 0 held, 0 suspended
```

This doesn't give any more information:

```bash
$ condor_q -analyze
```

Note that you can find some logs here:

```bash
$ cat /var/log/condor/              
.master_address      ProcLog              ScheddRestartReport  
MasterLog            SchedLog             SharedPortLog        
```

## TODO

- Why is idle?
- A non-interactive submit needs to write a submission file
- Tweak the configs to get envars that have the cluster size
- LAMMPS example working
